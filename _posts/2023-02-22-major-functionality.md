A Recimeal app is an Android application that allows users to search for, create, filter, and remove recipes.

### Search The Recipes

The Recimeal app includes a search option that allows users to find recipes that are displayed on the homepage. Users do not need to type the entire recipe name instead they can search for recipes using keywords. For instance, to find a recipe for "blueberry cheesecake" a user can simply type "blue" into the search box, and the recipe will display the results.

### Filter The Recipes

To filter the recipes, Recimeal have three buttons: "My Recipes," "Favourites," and "Ingredients." 

#### My Recipes

This feature displays all the recipes that the user has made. Simply turn on the My Recipes button and press the search icon, and the recipes created by the user will be displayed on the Recimeal homepage.

#### Favourites



#### Ingredients

This feature displays all the recipes that are relevant to the ingredients we typed into the search field. Users can use this function by turning on the button, typing in the ingredients, and then pressing the search icon. All the recipes that contain this ingredient item will appear on the Recimeal homepage.


### Create Your Own Recipes
Recimeal includes a feature that allows users to create their own recipes. To make their own recipe, users initially click on New Recipe and then enter the title of the recipe, a short description, a list of ingredients, and the instructions for making it and then click on create button. All the created recipes will be displayed on homepage.

### Delete The Recipes
Recimeal has a function that allows you to delete recipes. To delete a recipe, the user must first select the recipe to be deleted and then click the delete option. The recipe will then be removed from the homepage.
