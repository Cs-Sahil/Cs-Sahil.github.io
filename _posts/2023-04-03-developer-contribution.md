### Introducing Our Team and Our Experience Making Recimeal

**Haozhi Wang**

During the project, I learned how to use Java to connect to an SQL database and how to set up an SQL database for an Android app using HSQLDB. I also learned how to use Git better for communication and getting updates from other team members. This enabled me to collaborate more effectively and avoid conflicts or errors. Furthermore, I learned how to follow the SOLID principles to reduce the smell of the code. This improved the readability, reusability, and testability of the code. Finally, I learned how to apply some design patterns to make the code more maintainable and less error prone.
