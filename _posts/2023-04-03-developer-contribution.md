### Introducing Our Team and Our Experience Making Recimeal

**Haozhi Wang**

During the project, I learned how to use Java to connect to an SQL database and how to set up an SQL database for an Android app using HSQLDB. I also learned how to use Git better for communication and getting updates from other team members. This enabled me to collaborate more effectively and avoid conflicts or errors. Furthermore, I learned how to follow the SOLID principles to reduce the smell of the code. This improved the readability, reusability, and testability of the code. Finally, I learned how to apply some design patterns to make the code more maintainable and less error prone.

I was responsible for implementing the database and assisting with the design of the overall architecture.  I found it difficult to understand the requirements of our application and successfully split up the tasks associated with this design. Upon reflection, we could have saved time if we had spent more time in the planning stage of architecture design as lots of time was spent fixing mistakes. In the later stages of the development, I felt I had gained some good experience coordinating with the team to develop the project. I did enjoy the role of database management/ architecture development as it allowed me to try out all the layers of the project. This role made me more comfortable with database design and creating streamlined information channels. I feel although there were many lessons learned, in the end, the team was able to coordinate well and deliver a successful product.

**Manjyot Kalkat**

I gained valuable experience working on a project that involved designing the user interface and user experience. My experience in UI/UX allowed me to create designs that were not only aesthetically pleasing but also responsive to different screen sizes. This ensured that users could enjoy a seamless experience regardless of the device they were using. Additionally, I also implemented a bottom navigation bar, which allowed users to easily navigate from page to page. My understanding of app logic allowed me to create a smooth transition between pages, resulting in a seamless experience for the user. Overall, my experience in working on this Android Studio project opened me up to a new kind of application development and showed me the possibilities of it.

Through this project I learned skills for creating UI, adding its functionality, and polishing a finished product.  I made the display and logic for the search feature, the favourites feature, the create recipe feature and the search filters.  I also did much of the documentation required for each iteration, and stayed on top of helping to keep things organized.  I learned how the design and structure of an application is just as important as the actual code.  Perhaps most impactfully I gained valuable experience working with a group of strangers with limited time to create something that we can all be proud of.  Overall, I view our project as a success and it helped pique my interest in app development.


**Sahil**

The building process of the Recimeal was a very exciting. I gained knowledge about how to connect databases and use SQL statements, as well as how to create user interfaces and add functionality to them. I also created Recimeal's website and delete feature. I got a grasp of the SOLID and design principles that made the Recimeal app less prone to errors. The most useful lesson I think I learnt was working as a team for the first time on a really large project.
