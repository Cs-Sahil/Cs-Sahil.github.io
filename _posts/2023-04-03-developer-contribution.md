### Introducing Our Team and Our Experience Making Recimeal

**Haozhi Wang**

During the project, I learned how to use Java to connect to an SQL database and how to set up an SQL database for an Android app using HSQLDB. I also learned how to use Git better for communication and getting updates from other team members. This enabled me to collaborate more effectively and avoid conflicts or errors. Furthermore, I learned how to follow the SOLID principles to reduce the smell of the code. This improved the readability, reusability, and testability of the code. Finally, I learned how to apply some design patterns to make the code more maintainable and less error prone.

I was responsible for implementing the database and assisting with the design of the overall architecture.  I found it difficult to understand the requirements of our application and successfully split up the tasks associated with this design. Upon reflection, we could have saved time if we had spent more time in the planning stage of architecture design as lots of time was spent fixing mistakes. In the later stages of the development, I felt I had gained some good experience coordinating with the team to develop the project. I did enjoy the role of database management/ architecture development as it allowed me to try out all the layers of the project. This role made me more comfortable with database design and creating streamlined information channels. I feel although there were many lessons learned, in the end, the team was able to coordinate well and deliver a successful product.
