# Vision Statement

Recimeal helps you create your next meal. This recipe collection application allows you to quickly save, search and create recipes. Users can more efficiently find recipes to suit their needs via searching for recipes or add their own at any time without the hassle of a traditional cookbook.
The app is self-contained and does not require a connection to any outside app. This means it does not need an internet connection, nor permissions to access other apps. This makes it accessible offline, and people who do not like giving out permissions can use the app without worry. The app comes preloaded with some recipes, and any updates to this core set would be issued by an app update.
The system is an app built to work on a Samsung Galaxy S20 FE phone, as well as emulators of it. Support for other platforms may be considered in the future.
The app can be useful to anyone who cooks but is focused on busy people who benefit from having easy access to recipes. Many people are looking to cut down on take-out but lack the time to invest in searching for or thinking of meals to make. Often searching for recipes online yields advertisements and long descriptive paragraphs that clutter the actual recipe. This app allows users to find recipes quickly and thoughtlessly by search or recommendations, letting them get straight to prep and save valuable time.
For a user who knows what they want, searching can be done by name to find recipes for a specific dish, for example ‘dinner roll’ or ‘muffin’.  For users who are not as sure, searching can also be done by ingredient or tags such as ‘breakfast’, ‘dessert’, ’Indian’ or other. Other means of search such as prep time will be considered. The search feature can be specified to show user created recipes only or all recipes. Users can also favourite recipes to create a shortlist of recipes they frequent or are planning to make.
Users can add their own recipes and add notes onto other recipes, allowing them to make the app their own. When adding a recipe, the user can specify ingredients, description, prep instructions, name, and search tags. Users can add recipes from anywhere via their device, such as while thinking about dinner on the bus, whereas actual cookbooks are not often brought outside the home.
Users can be recommended recipes based on their previous searches and favourites.
The application shows its value in being able to work faster than a traditional cookbook and provide more features like editing recipes and ranking recipes. People are getting busier so saving time on cooking becomes more important. However, recipes are hard to remember by heart, so people need something to help them follow the instructions. Faster than cookbooks, the application can play this role perfectly.
The goal of this application is to be faster than a traditional cookbook, both for finding recipes and adding them. This system will be considered successful if it is faster to add to and search in than a cookbook on average. This will be measured by having an average user be able to find a desired recipe in under a minute. With regards to adding a recipe a user should be able to add a recipe in under 3 minutes.
